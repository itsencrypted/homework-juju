# 1. Why is client diversity important for Ethereum ?

Client diversity is important for Ethereum for several reasons. First, it **reduces the risk of a single point of failure in the network**. If all nodes on the network are running the same client software and that software has a vulnerability, the entire network could be compromised. However, if there are multiple client implementations running on the network, the impact of any single vulnerability is reduced.

Second, client diversity **promotes decentralization** of the network. Decentralization risk: If a single client implementation dominates the network, it creates centralization around that implementation and undermines the decentralization benefits of blockchain technology.

Other risks involved are:

##### Vulnerability risk

If a single client implementation dominates the network, it increases the risk of a single point of failure. If that client implementation has a vulnerability or bug that is exploited, it could potentially compromise the entire network.

##### Attack surface

A single client implementation offers a larger attack surface to potential attackers than multiple implementations. With only one client implementation in use, attackers can focus their efforts on finding vulnerabilities and exploits specific to that implementation, rather than having to target multiple implementations with varying codebases.

##### Upgrade risk

When a new version of the Ethereum protocol is released, it is possible that some client implementations may not support the upgrade immediately. If a single client implementation is used by the majority of the network, it could create a bottleneck and prevent the network from upgrading smoothly.

##### CONSENSUS BUG

[In this video](https://www.youtube.com/live/wklZU_MYnAk?feature=share&t=1789) Terence Tsao discusses the risks of running a single client implementation in Ethereum and how a bug in a single client can lead to a consensus bug. He explains that a consensus bug occurs when there is a disagreement between nodes in the network about the current state of the blockchain. This can occur if a client implementation contains a bug that causes it to interpret the blockchain data differently from other client implementations.

If a consensus bug occurs, it can lead to a fork in the blockchain where some nodes see one version of the blockchain and others see another version. This can lead to a breakdown in the consensus mechanism and potentially compromise the security and reliability of the blockchain network.

**_To prevent consensus bugs, Terence emphasizes the importance of client diversity and using multiple client implementations that have been thoroughly tested and audited to ensure that they interpret the blockchain data in a consistent and accurate manner._**

# 2. Where is the full Ethereum state held ?

The full Ethereum state is held on every node that participates in the Ethereum network. Each node maintains a copy of the entire Ethereum blockchain, which contains all historical transactions and the current state of all accounts on the network.

The state is stored in a data structure called the Ethereum Patricia tree, which is a type of Merkle tree. The tree allows for efficient storage and retrieval of account information, including account balances, contract code, and storage.

Since every node maintains a copy of the full state, the network is decentralized and resilient. This means that even if some nodes fail or are attacked, the network can continue to function because there are still many other nodes that maintain a copy of the full state.

# 3. What is a replay attack ? , which 2 pieces of information can prevent it ?

A replay attack is a type of attack in which a valid data transmission is fraudulently repeated or delayed. In the context of Ethereum, a replay attack occurs when a transaction that was intended for one network is maliciously or accidentally replayed on another network, causing unintended consequences.

To prevent replay attacks, two pieces of information can be used: the chain ID and the nonce. The chain ID is a unique identifier for a specific Ethereum network, and it is included in each transaction. By requiring transactions to include the correct chain ID, the network can ensure that transactions are only executed on the intended network and not accidentally replayed on another network.

The nonce is a number that is included in each transaction and is incremented with each subsequent transaction from the same account. By requiring transactions to include a valid nonce, the network can ensure that each transaction is unique and prevent any attempts to replay a previously executed transaction.

# 4. In a contract, how do we know who called a view function ?

In a contract, a view function is a function that does not modify the state of the contract and only reads data from the contract. Since view functions do not modify the contract state, they can be called by anyone without incurring gas fees.

When a view function is called, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) creates a new message call but does not modify the contract state. The caller of the view function is identified by the `msg.sender` variable, which contains the address of the account that initiated the message call.

Therefore, when a view function is called, the contract can determine who called it by inspecting the `msg.sender` variable. This information can be used to implement access control mechanisms, such as restricting access to certain functions or data based on the identity of the caller.
